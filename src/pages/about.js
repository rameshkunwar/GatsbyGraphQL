            The field of web (or mobile app) development is continuously and
            rapidly changing. A developer not only need to sharpen ones skill
            but also need to learn new. And, I believe in

            Coder, developer or architect?
          </h3>
          <Paragraph>
            I would like to call myself a motivated developer learning to become
            an architect one day. Currently, I am focused on learning and
            partially implementing Domain-Driven Design, SOLID principles and
            clean architecture. I am also very keen on learning one of the
            message queuing system (Kafka or RabbitMQ). Last but not the least,
            actor based systems such as Erlang has fascinated me. Fortunately,
            similar system called Akka.NET has been ported to the .net world. I
            firmly believe, Akka.net is a good alternative to a build a
            highly-available highly-scalable system such as Erlang.
