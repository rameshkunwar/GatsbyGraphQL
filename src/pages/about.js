            particularly React JS. Well, this is a topic, itself, for a blog!

            The field of web (or mobile app) development is continuously and
            rapidly changing. A developer not only need to sharpen ones skill
            but also need to learn new. And, I believe in

            Let's learn together!! The main purpose of the blog is to share the
            knowledge I have acquired and learn new things with the world.

            I would like to call myself a motivated developer, with architecture
            in mind. I am continuously sharpening my skills as well as learning
            new things that I need most. Most of the time, I follow a tutorial
            or read books/articles about the subject matter. Then, I try to
            build something out of it. However, I found out that If I were to
            teach someone the same thing, I would have to do more research, had
            to dig even dipper. I hope this blog will help me to be even better
            and could help others as well.

            I do have architecture in my mind. I practice and try to strictly
            implement SOLID principles. I do practice Domain-Driven design in
            medium to large project. I believe, we developer, should not just
            write code to solve problems, but, should write code that human can
            understand, that is modular, and that is clean.

            I have a family and love to spend time with them. I am also a
            Manchester United fan and never miss a chance to watch the playing.
            Apart from football, I do watch Formula 1 championship almost every
            sunday and if possible, qualifying session on saturdays.
